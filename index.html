            <ul class="timeline">
                <li><strong>1912: </strong>Alan Mathison Turing born in Maida Vale, London, to Ethel Sara Turing
                    (nee
                    Stoney) and Julius Mathison Turing.</li>
                <li><strong>1927-30: </strong>Alan furthers his love of science and maths by reading Einstein whilst
                    at
                    Sherborne. His great friend, Christopher
                    Morcom, who shares his interests, suddenly dies. Alan is devastated..</li>
                <li><strong>1934: </strong>Alan graduates with distinction in Mathematics from King's College,
                    Cambridge.</li>
                <li><strong>1938: </strong>Alan goes to Princeton University in America to study mathematics and is
                    awarded a PhD.</li>
                <li><strong>1939: </strong>September - Alan is asked to join the Government Codes and Ciphers School
                    and
                    arrives at Bletchley Park the day after
                    war is declared.</li>
                <li><strong>1940: </strong>With Gordon Welchman, Alan develops the Bombe to decipher the messages
                    sent
                    by the Germans using their Enigma machine.</li>
                <li><strong>1943-45: </strong>Alan works with top people in the USA, which he visits to share
                    information on code breaking.</li>
                <li><strong>1945: </strong>At the end of the war, Alan Turing is awarded the OBE for his wartime
                    services.</li>
                <li><strong>1946: </strong>Alan publishes a paper with the first detailed design of a stored-program
                    computer.
                    services.</li>
                <li><strong>1949: </strong>Alan is made deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester
                    University.</li>
                <li><strong>1950: </strong>Alan publishes the famous paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in
                    which he develops the Turing Test.</li>
                <li><strong>1952: </strong>At the end of the war, Alan Turing is awarded the OBE for his wartime
                    services.</li>
                <li><strong> 1952: </strong>Alan is arrested for gross indecency. He loses his security clearance so

                    cannot work. He is offered chemical
                    treatment instead of going to prison. The treatment makes him very unwell..</li>
                <li><strong>1954: </strong>Alan dies in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, from poisoning. A half-eaten

                    cyanide.</li>
                <li><strong>1945: </strong>At the end of the war, Alan Turing is awarded the OBE for his wartime
                    services.</li>
                <li><strong>1986: </strong>A play, Breaking the Code, about Alan's life and work opens in the West
                    End
                    with Derek Jacobi playing Alan.</li>

                <li><strong>2007: </strong>A slate sculpture of Alan Turing is unveiled at Bletchley Park.</li>
                <li><strong>2009: </strong>Thousands of people sign a petition. The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown
                    makes a
                    public apology saying the treatment of
                    Alan Turing was "appalling".</li>
